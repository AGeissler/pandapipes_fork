Plotting with pandapipes
########################

pandapipes offers a few functions to plot grids using matplotlib. The general way
to plot a network is to generate a collection of each of the components within the
network and then draw these collections in pyplot. In order to get started, the sections
on simple plotting and the plotting tutorial in the tutorial folder are useful.
