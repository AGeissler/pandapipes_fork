Run a time series with multiple coupled networks
================================================

.. _run_me_timeseries_ppipe:

To run a coupled time series simulation, this function has to be called:

.. autofunction:: pandapipes.multinet.timeseries.run_time_series_multinet.run_timeseries

Attention! The function called is not the function you find in pandapipes.timeseries.run_time_series,
but the function you find in pandapipes.multinet.timeseries.run_time_series!

Further information on how to set up a time series simulation with a power and gas net is given
in the second part of the tutorial `coupled_nets_h2_p2g2p.ipynb <https://github.com/e2nIEE/pandapipes/blob/develop/tutorials/coupled_nets_h2_p2g2p.ipynb>`_.
